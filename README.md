### Purpose
This is my portfolio from taking Tufts's COMP20 (Web Programming) course. It contains assignments I completed throughout the semester, which are:
* [Captain's Log](./captainslog)
* [Not Uber](./notuber)
* [Responsive Design](./responsive)
* [Rick Roll](./rickroll)
* [Security Analysis](./security)

### Reflection on Assignments
Looking back, my favorite assignment was the Rick Roll lab, which was my first real introduction to JavaScript and asynchronous design. Working with "Never Gonna Give You Up" was funny and made me laugh, but it was also my first time creating something that wasn't fully static. It showed me a small glimpse into the power of web development!

### Reflection on Myself
I think I've grown significantly since the beginning of this course. Ming's teaching style has allowed me to learn to teach myself - I have learned the skills to go off on my own and continue to learn. I feel much more confident in trying out new frameworks and APIs after learning the basics of web, which I believe will make a huge success in my willingness to try out new projects, and my ability to complete them!

### Reflection on the Course
Technically, I think the most important thing I learned in this course was JavaScript. Being asynchronous, it behaves like other JavaScript frameworks and technologies at the heart of web programmming, which was the biggest adjustment for me coming from C++ and Java. I think that change in mindset was incredibly important for my success in the class and my future in web dev.

Qualitatively, I think "learning how to learn", as discussed above, was crucial. In industry, there's no list of TAs with office hours to ask when you get stuck; outside of academia, Stack Overflow and Google are your best friends. COMP20 has been like training wheels for being in the "real world", and I've started to get a sense of how to help myself, with resources like TAs and Ming when I'm really stuck. This is much more conducive for the kind of learning that I will be doing this summer, and for the rest of my life. 

### What next?
Since before I started COMP20, I've been interested in UI/UX and HCI. I hope to take the HCI course at some point, and am currently involved in some UI/UX research through MIT. Ming mentioned in class that there are many applications that are unsuccessful because of the lack of thought to how the user interacts with the product - I think it's crucial to the design process, and hope to learn more about how to design for the user through future courses, internships and research!
